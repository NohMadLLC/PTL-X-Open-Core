# PTL-X: Open Core Simulation (v1.0)

**Recursive Time Distortion Modeling**  
Developed by Breezon Brown · NohMad LLC · July 2025  
Patent Protected – US Provisional Patent No. 63/847,201

---

## 🧠 Overview

PTL-X is a scientific model that quantifies **subjective time distortion** due to trauma using three recursive variables:

- **Memory Density (M)**  
- **Emotional Charge (E)**  
- **Recursive Loop Intensity (R)**

Open-core formula:
\[
T' = \alpha \cdot \tanh\left( \frac{\beta \cdot (M \cdot E)}{R + \gamma} \right)
\]
