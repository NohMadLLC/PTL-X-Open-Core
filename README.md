PTL-X Open Core

Recursive Temporal Lensing Simulation: A Trauma-Based Time Distortion Model



 Overview

PTL-X Open Core is the publicly licensed simulation model of the PTL-X system — a novel theoretical framework and empirical tool designed to model subjective time distortion caused by emotional trauma.

This repository contains the non-proprietary core components of PTL-X, enabling researchers, developers, and clinical scientists to explore how trauma alters time perception through recursive emotional-memory interactions.

PTL-X is built on the foundational hypothesis that trauma fragments internal time perception through emotional charge, memory density, and recursion failure — creating measurable distortions in lived experience. This model transforms trauma from a symbolic narrative into a computational and biometric phenomenon.



What This Version Is
	•	A simulation environment for exploring trauma-time dynamics using synthetic data
	•	A tool for academic and scientific exploration of recursive trauma loops
	•	A non-commercial validation layer supporting the core PTL-X white paper
	•	A public interface for research, collaboration, and educational adaptation
	•	A safe demonstration version stripped of proprietary healing protocols, biometric pipelines, and recursive entropy metrics



 What This Version Is Not
	•	This is not the full PTL-X engine. It does not include the protected biomarker feedback system or the licensed trauma-mapping modules
	•	It is not a clinical diagnostic or therapeutic tool
	•	It cannot be used in commercial applications, AI model training, derivative tools, or therapeutic deployments without express licensing
	•	It is not open-source in the traditional sense — it is governed by a custom non-commercial academic license
